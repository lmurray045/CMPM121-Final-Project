## Tools and Materials
We have chosen to use Phaser3 as our main framework. This is because we all have experience with making games in Phaser3 from our time at CMPM120 - Game Development Experience. While for some of us it has been a while since we've last used Phaser3, having prior experience with this framework will allow us to tackle this project much more effectively compared to one that some of us have never used before. Furthermore, as this framework specializes in video games designed for the web, using it will help to further expand our knowledge on those types of games.

As a result of us using Phaser3 as our framework, the programming language and data language will be JavaScript and JSON expectedly. This is also because we all have some experience with coding in these languages before, making us more equipped to make a game using them.

For the other tools that we plan on utilizing for this project, we will be using Visual Studio Code as our IDE, and Photoshop, Paint.net, or Gimp for the process of creating visual assets. These are all tools that we currently use for our other game design projects and so we are comfortable and confident in our ability to work on them. In the case for the visual design tools, as some of us have never used these before, this project will also be a great source of exposure and experience with these tools.

Lastly, for our alternate platform choice, we plan on changing our primary language to TypeScript. This is because whilst TypeScript is similar to JavaScript, it does come with some unique features that we've recently been introduced to during our time in this course. Thus, by switching to this language, we will be given more experience with this new language as well as develop a better understanding of how it compares to the likes of JavaScript.

## Outlook
By developing this project, we are looking to be able to expand our knowledge of the TypeScript language and learn more about how it compares with JavaScript. We are also aiming to focus on the portability of both the JavaScript and TypeScript languages, and potentially create a game that is accessible on all web platforms without requiring our players to download it first. As a result of this, the most difficult part about this project would be the transition from JavaScript to TypeScript, as the two language's difference in abilities can result in some problems occuring down the line. Therefore, we will be sure to research how we can effectively make the switch between languages before implementing it so that we are better prepared for this challenge.
